# Welcome to Historiography (HIST 491)!

## This is our repository for submitting and accessing course work. Remember that you must be logged into GitHub to add files to the repository.

All work must be submitted in Markdown. If you are confused about Markdown, complete this [Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). If you need syntax help, check out this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet).

If you want to preview your Markdown text as you write, use [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/). You can export your text as a Markdown file and drag and drop into GitHub, or Create a New File on GitHub and then copy and paste your text from Dillinger into the edit window on GitHub.
